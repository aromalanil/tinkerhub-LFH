                <h2>What is coronavirus?</h2>
                <p>According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the
                    common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle
                    East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted between animals and
                    people. SARS, for instance, was transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS moved to humans
                    from a type of camel. Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases, meaning they spread from animals to
                    humans. <br><br> The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since
                    named
                    COVID-19, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. It is said this virus
                    originated from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally. <br><br>As of
                    now, a
                    vaccine has not been formulated for the novel coronavirus. Coronavirus started in China and has
                    affected many people worldwide. It has 106,490 cases to date and has caused 3600 deaths. As per the
                    last record, 39 cases of coronavirus have been reported in India.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing
                    difficulties. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even
                    death. Current estimates of the incubation period – the amount of time between infection and the
                    onset of symptoms – ranging from one to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to
                    six days. However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any
                    symptoms despite having the virus in their systems. The elderly, especially those with pre-existing
                    conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease, may be severely affected by the new
                    virus.

                <h2>How does the coronavirus spread?</h2>

                <h4>1. Person-to-person spread</h4>
                <p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
                    </li>
                    <li>Respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this
                        occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                        spreads.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects</h4>
                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus
                    on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.</p>

                <h2>Coronavirus: Preventive measures</h2>
                <h4>Here are a few important tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands: wet your hands with clean, running water and apply soap. Lather your hands,
                        including the backs, between your fingers, and under your nails and scrub for at least 20
                        seconds. Rinse.
                    </li>
                    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least
                        60% alcohol.
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintain high hand hygiene, avoid touching things around when at public places.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid going to crowded areas. Avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid handshakes and hugs, greet people with a “Namaste”.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the
                        bin and wash your hands. If you do not have a tissue to hand, cough or sneeze into your elbow
                        rather than your hands. Stay home if you are sick.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain at least three feet distance between
                        yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaner.
                    </li>
                    <li>Face masks offer some protection as they block liquid droplets. However, they do not block
                        smaller aerosol particles that can pass through the material of the mask. The masks also leave
                        the eyes exposed and there is evidence that some viruses can infect a person through the eyes.
                    </li>
                    <li>If visiting live markets in affected areas avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals
                        and surfaces that have been in contact with animals.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have returned from an infected area and develop a high temperature, cough, runny nose,
                        sore throat or difficulty breathing do not leave your home until you have been given advice by a
                        doctor.
                    </li>

                <h2>Face mask</h2>
                <p>There are many misconceptions regarding the use of a face mask. Here is when you must use a face
                    mask: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with the
                        suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based
                        hand rub or soap and water.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub
                        or soap and water.
                    </li>
                    <li>Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.
                    </li>
                    <li>To remove the mask: remove it from behind (do not touch the front of the mask); discard
                        immediately in a closed bin; clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
                    </li>
                </ul>
